Keep my embedded chops and have some fun in the process --> make a motion sensor to detect door opening and actuate a servo motor and speaker to operate a skull jaw to scare those who enter

///////// EDITS //////////////

motion sensor was quick and simple - gonna bring back to life a broken robot from a couple years ago.... note to self: don't touch an 18 V power rail to a 5 V power rail, sending 23 V back into a computer USB port. Nothing good comes out of that. 

////////// NEW PLAN /////////////

create a python client interface to communicate with ESP32 over BT connection to control robot using arrow keys on computer. Maybe even make an HTML website to make commands, but who knows. 

////////// UPDATE //////////
 
just found out what the name of the old robot used to be, this project is now project "revive scoosh"
